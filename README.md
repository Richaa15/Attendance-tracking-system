### Abstract
The Face Recognition-Based Attendance System is an advanced method for efficiently recording student attendance. This innovative system employs facial biometrics and cutting-edge information technology to recognize students' faces in real-time accurately. It's designed to work seamlessly with high-definition monitors and video feeds from webcams or surveillance cameras.

In this project, the computer system excels at rapidly and accurately detecting human faces within images or video streams. It leverages face recognition algorithms to achieve this. Once a face is detected and processed, the system cross-references it with existing records and updates the attendance database accordingly.

The unique characteristics of the human face make it an ideal choice for individual identification. The likelihood of a face being duplicated or misidentified is remarkably low. This robust system offers a dependable and secure way to track and verify student identities for attendance purposes, promising efficiency and accuracy.


### Problem Statement
The biggest issue in the former attendance management system is the accuracy of the data collected. This is because the attendance might not be recorded personally by the original person, in other words, a third party can take the attendance of a particular person without the realization of the institution which violates the accuracy of the data. 

#### To do:
* Record Student Details in a Database
* Train Photo samples of the students


### Algorithms Used
* Haarcascade OpenCV(Face Detection)
* LBPH OpenCV(Face Recognition)
